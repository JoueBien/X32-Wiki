# Introduction
Welcome to the X32 User Manual! After years of intense development, we are proud to offer a mixer that combines tremendous power and flexibility with a very user-friendly layout and intuitive workflow that allow you to get up-and-running right away.


The X32 is the fully-integrated centerpiece of BEHRINGER’s digital mixing, audio networking and processing ecosystem. It combines a control surface with streamlined workflow, extensive I/O and signal processing into a compact desktop form factor. Employing motorized faders and rotary encoders along with a daylight-viewable TFT screen, the control surface is designed to allow immediate access to critical functions with total and automatic recall of settings. Extensive on-board I/O includes 40 A/D and 24 D/A Cirrus Logic converters, 96 bidirectional channels over SuperMAC AES50, stereo AES/EBU out, 16 channels of BEHRINGER’s Ultranet personal monitoring and 32 x 32 channels for recording over USB.


Abundant analog connectivity is provided via 32 MIDAS-designed digitally-controllable microphone preamps, 6 line-level auxiliary in- and outputs, 16 XLR outputs, stereo monitoring outs on XLR/TRS and dual phones outputs. Each of the 32 microphone inputs can accept balanced or unbalanced mic or line-level level signals and include switchable phantom power, 72 dB gain range and max +23 dBu level before clip. A separate external mic input and the internal talkback mic allow communication to various destinations.


Dual AES50 Ethernet jacks that employ KLARK TEKNIK SuperMAC technology contribute 96 x 96 signals to the total count of 168 x 168 accessible sources and destinations. Motorized faders, recallable mic preamps, programmable routing and the ability to save and recall entire scenes make set or program changes quick and simple. A top panel USB connector enables system data to be stored or a board mix to be recorded directly to external flash or hard drives.


The Input section is home for 16 high-resolution 100 mm motorized faders, providing control over channels 1-16, 17-32, Aux inputs / USB playback / FX returns. A separate section of 8 motorized faders controls DCA groups 1-8, bus masters 1-8 and 9-16 as well as matrices 1-6. The master "X-channel" section allows instant editing of the currently selected channel’s gain, dynamics, EQ and other functions. A custom assignable section allows certain control functions to be mapped directly to a set of dedicated knobs and buttons.


A main 7"-wide, high-contrast color display provides information for editing pertinent parameters of the active function or effect. Relevant parameters are quickly recalled to the display for editing via "view" buttons in each sub-section. Each channel also features a small, customizable LCD screen for track name, number, color and source graphic.


A virtual FX rack offers 8 true-stereo (16 mono) multi-effects processors, with 39 FX models that eliminate the need for any additional outboard gear. 4 high-quality effects such as delay, chorus and reverb can run concurrently with 8 channels of 31-band graphic equalization.


The built-in interface card enables streaming of up to 32 tracks to and from a computer for recording, mixing and mastering purposes.


The X32 integrates seamlessly with other X32 consoles, the S16 digital stage box and the P-16 personal monitoring system for complete live, studio and installed sound solutions. Control the mixer from a distance with the free iPad app or with editing and remote control software connected via Ethernet. The X32’s ease of use, intuitive workflow, diverse feature set and integration with other equipment make it an ideal centerpiece for installed and production sound in any setting.
