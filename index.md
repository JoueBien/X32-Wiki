# Overview
This project aims to restore the content from the X32 Wiki.
The primary goal is to move all the content from the version stored in the [web archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20140522232726/http://x32wiki.music-group.com/index.php?title=Main_Page) into markdown.
After that is complete the markdown will be embedded into a website that is publicly available out side source control.

**This is an opinionated port.** There are likely going to be a number of changes to make reading the content easier and the formatting more consistent. Where information is out of date or wrong the content will be updated to the correct information.

Any issues or edits or modifications should be submitted through the source controls issue tracker.
